# 🎮 CPU Scheduling Quiz & Simulator

An interactive **CPU Scheduling Simulator + Quiz Game** built in **Bash/Python** to learn and test knowledge of scheduling algorithms.  
This project combines **algorithm simulation (Gantt charts, waiting time, turnaround time)** with **randomized quizzes** to make learning fun and engaging! 🚀



## ✨ Features
- 🔹 Simulation of popular CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - RR (Round Robin)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - EDF (Earliest Deadline First)
  - RMS (Rate Monotonic Scheduling)
  - DMS (Deadline Monotonic Scheduling)

- 🔹 **Randomized Quiz** for each algorithm:
  - 10 question bank per algorithm
  - 3 random questions asked per session
  - Scoring system with results saved to `quiz_score.txt`

- 🔹 **Learning + Fun** → Play a quiz after running each algorithm simulation
